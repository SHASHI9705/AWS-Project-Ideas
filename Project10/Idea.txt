Project 10: Jamstack Site with AWS â€“ Use AWS Amplify, Headless CMS, and S3 
for a Jamstack website. 
Build a modern, fast, and scalable Jamstack website using AWS Amplify, a 
Headless CMS, and S3 for static hosting. This approach decouples the frontend 
from the backend, improving performance, security, and scalability. 
Steps to Build the Jamstack Site with AWS 

Step 1: Set Up AWS Amplify 
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console. 
2. Navigate to AWS Amplify and create a new project. 
3. Connect a GitHub repository containing your frontend code (React, Vue, or 
Next.js). 
4. Configure Amplify for continuous deployment. 

Step 2: Choose a Headless CMS 
1. Select a Headless CMS like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity. 
2. Create a new project and define content models (e.g., blog posts, pages). 
3. Publish and retrieve content via the CMS API. 

Step 3: Configure AWS S3 for Static Hosting 
1. Open the AWS S3 Console and create a new bucket. 
2. Enable static website hosting in the bucket settings. 
3. Upload your pre-built static files if using S3 as an alternative deployment 
option. 

Step 4: Connect CMS with Frontend 
1. Fetch data from the CMS using REST or GraphQL APIs. 
2. Display dynamic content on your website using API calls. 

Step 5: Deploy and Test the Website 
1. Deploy the frontend via AWS Amplify or S3. 
2. Enable CDN via AWS CloudFront for fast global access. 
3. Test your website and verify performance. 

Step 6: Set Up Custom Domain and SSL 
1. Configure a custom domain in AWS Route 53. 
2. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to enable HTTPS. 

Conclusion 
This project helps create a fast, secure, and scalable Jamstack website using AWS 
services. With AWS Amplify for deployment, a Headless CMS for content 
management, and S3 for storage, you ensure a seamless user experience
